Shopping Cart App (Flutter)

This project is a shopping cart application built using Flutter, focusing on frontend development and application logic without using any backend services. The main purpose of this project is to understand how a complete and functional shopping experience can be created using only Flutter basics such as UI design, state management, and navigation.

All features of the app work locally within the application, making it a fully functional frontend project that simulates a real e-commerce experience.

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a complete shopping cart system using Flutter without relying on a backend or database. This project demonstrates how product listings, cart operations, and price calculations can be handled entirely on the client side using Flutter.

Features

The shopping cart app includes a complete set of essential e-commerce features. Users can browse products, view product details, add items to the cart, update item quantities, and remove products from the cart. The cart automatically calculates the total price based on selected items and quantities. Smooth navigation between screens and a clean user interface are also key features of the app.

App Functionality

The app displays a list of products using static or locally stored data. Each product contains basic information such as name, price, and image. When a user adds a product to the cart, the app updates the cart state instantly. The cart screen reflects all selected items along with quantity controls and total price calculation. Since there is no backend, all data is managed in memory during runtime.

Tech Stack

The app is built using Flutter and Dart. Flutter is used to design the user interface and manage navigation between screens. Dart handles the application logic, cart state management, and calculations. No backend, database, or external API is used in this project.

Learning Outcome

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Flutter fundamentals. I learned how to build multi-screen applications, manage application state, handle user interactions, and implement business logic such as cart calculations. It also improved my understanding of how real-world app features can be simulated without a backend.
